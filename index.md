## MTAAC/CDLI Documentation
This documentation site was created as part of the [MTAAC](https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/) project to document its research process, tool development and to supplement the code and data deliverables with extensive explanations and walkthrough to encourage our colleagues to reuse our work. 

Participants in the project and contributors to this documentation are Émilie Pagé-Perron, Ilya Khait, Lucas Reckling, Pouya Lajevardi, Prashant Rajput, Maria Sukhareva, Robert K. Englund, Heather D. Baker and Christian Chicarcos.


The documentation is currently under development so please bear with us and send us an e-mail if you have questions. 


Navigate using the menu at the left or use the search bar available at the top right.

To contribute, first read the [quick edit instructions "Intro for editors"](https://cdli-gh.github.io/edit-intro.html).
